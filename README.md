# SysAdmin-PowerShell-Tools
This repo contains different PowerShell scripts for various SysAdmin tasks. 

## Introduction
Hey everyone, thanks for checking this out. I have been using PowerShell extensively over the last 4 or so years, and I wanted to share some of the tools that I have built. I am currently going through all of my tools, verifying that they are updated for security and functionality, and formatting them based on PowerShell best practices to make sure that they are:

1. Easy to use
2. Easy to read
3. Providing error handling to let you know what broke
4. Not storing any sensitive information or secrets

## Release Plan

I will hopefully be adding a script every week or so, and will likely start with my exchange tools for managing mailboxes, distribution groups, Teams, SharePoint, etc. After that, I will go back through my scripts I used on desktop, which are more centered on providing information on computer and user accounts in an on-prem or hybrid environment. 

If you see an error with the scripts, be that a security or functionality concern, please reach out and let me know. 

I enjoy designing these tools, so if you have an idea or want to collaborate on something, let me know.
